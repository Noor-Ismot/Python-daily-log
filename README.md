Daily Python practice covering fundamentals, problem-solving, automation, and mini-projects, tracked to build strong programming foundations.

# LEARN PYTHON : DAY 1
Topics: Variables, Data Type, Type Casting, Output, Comments, Conditions, Logical Operators, Nested if, Pass statement
Summary:
- Variables are used to store data values and can be created by assigning a value using the equals sign (=).
- Python has various data types, including text, numeric, sequence, mapping, set, boolean, and binary types.
- The print() function is used to display output, and you can customize its behavior using parameters like end.
- You can assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line and print multiple variables together.
- The type() function helps determine the data type of a variable, and type casting allows you to convert variables to specific data types.
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else) are used to execute code based on specific conditions, and shorthand if...else can be used for concise conditional assignments.
- Logical operators (and, or, not) allow you to combine multiple conditions in your statements.
- Nested if statements enable you to check conditions within other conditions.
- The pass statement serves as a placeholder for future code, allowing you to define empty blocks without causing syntax errors.

Topics: Data Structures - Lists [Part 1]
- Lists are ordered, mutable (changeable), and allow duplicate values.
- Lists are defined using square brackets [].
- You can access list items using their index, and you can also use slicing to access a range of items.
- You can add items to a list using append(), insert(), and extend() methods.
- You can change list items by specifying the index or a range of indices.
- You can sort and reverse lists using sort() and reverse() methods.
- You can check if an item exists in a list using the 'in' keyword.

Topics: Data Structures - Lists [Part 2]
- Looping through a list using for loop with and without range function.
- Looping through a list using while loop.
- Looping through a list using list comprehension.
- Copying a list using copy() method.
- Joining two lists using + operator and extend() method.
- Removing list items using remove(), pop(), del keyword, and clear() method.
