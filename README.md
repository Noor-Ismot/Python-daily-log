Topics: Variables, Data Type, Type Casting, Output, Comments, Conditions, Logical Operators, Nested if, Pass statement
Summary:
- Variables are used to store data values and can be created by assigning a value using the equals sign (=).
- Python has various data types, including text, numeric, sequence, mapping, set, boolean, and binary types.
- The print() function is used to display output, and you can customize its behavior using parameters like end.
- You can assign multiple values to multiple variables in one line and print multiple variables together.
- The type() function helps determine the data type of a variable, and type casting allows you to convert variables to specific data types.
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else) are used to execute code based on specific conditions, and shorthand if...else can be used for concise conditional assignments.
- Logical operators (and, or, not) allow you to combine multiple conditions in your statements.
- Nested if statements enable you to check conditions within other conditions.
- The pass statement serves as a placeholder for future code, allowing you to define empty blocks without causing syntax errors.
